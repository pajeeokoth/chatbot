    "# Fly Me\n",
    "A travel provider for individuals and professionals. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The chatbot project - Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "Fly Me has launched an ambitious project to develop a *chatbot* to *help users choose a travel offer*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first phase of this project is to **develop an MVP** that will help Fly Me employees to easily book airline tickets for their holidays.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first MVP will allow us to test the concept and performance of the chatbot quickly and on a large scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "As this project is iterative, we have limited the features of the chatbot V1. It must be able to identify the following five elements in the user's request:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Departure city\n",
    "* Destination city\n",
    "* Desired flight departure date\n",
    "* Desired flight return date\n",
    "* Maximum budget for the total price of tickets\n",
    "\n",
    "If one of the elements is missing, the chatbot must be able to ask the user the relevant questions in order to fully understand the request. When the chatbot thinks it has understood all the elements of the user's request, it must be able to reformulate the user's request and ask the user for confirmation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools and Technologies used\n",
    "To carry out this project, we will need to use the following tools and technologies:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Microsoft Bot Framework source code for Python “Microsoft Bot Framework SDK v4 for Python” \n",
    "* The Azure LUIS Cognitive Service which allows you to perform a semantic analysis of a message entered by the user and structure it for processing by the bot (it should allow you to identify the five elements requested)\n",
    "* The Azure Web App service that allows you to run a web application on the Azure Cloud (you won't need to use the Azure Bot service)\n",
    "* The Bot Framework Emulator which will allow you to test your chatbot locally and in production. It is an interface that allows a user to interact with the chatbot.\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "The data used to train the LUIS model comes from a dataset of conversations between users and travel agents. This dataset is in JSON format and contains a total of 1500 conversations. Each conversation consists of a series of messages exchanged between the user and the travel agent. The messages contain information about the user's travel preferences, such as departure city, destination city, travel dates, and budget.\n",
    "The dataset is divided into two parts: a training set and a test set. The training set contains 1200 conversations and is used to train the LUIS model. The test set contains 300 conversations and is used to evaluate the performance of the LUIS model.\n",
    "The dataset is available in the `data/frames_dataset` directory of the project. The main file is `frames.json`, which contains all the conversations. The file is structured as follows:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"conversations\": [\n",
    "    {\n",
    "      \"id\": \"1\",\n",
    "      \"turns\": [\n",
    "        {\n",
    "          \"speaker\": \"user\",\n",
    "          \"text\": \"I want to book a flight from New York to Paris.\"\n",
    "        },\n",
    "        {\n",
    "          \"speaker\": \"agent\",\n",
    "          \"text\": \"Sure, when do you want to depart?\"\n",
    "        },\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "      ]\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "  ]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `turns` field contains a list of messages exchanged between the user and the travel agent. Each message has a `speaker` field indicating who sent the message (either \"user\" or \"agent\") and a `text` field containing the content of the message.\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "The objective of this notebook is to explore and preprocess the dataset to prepare it for training the LUIS model. This includes loading the JSON file, flattening the nested structure, and extracting relevant information from the conversations.\n"

    "## What is a bot?\n",
    "Bots provide an experience that feels less like using a computer and more like dealing with a person—or intelligent robot. You can use bots to shift simple, repetitive tasks—such as taking a dinner reservation or gathering profile information—onto automated systems that may no longer require direct human intervention. Users converse with a bot using text, interactive cards, and speech. A bot interaction can be a quick answer to a question or an involved conversation that intelligently provides access to services."

    "#### Generate a LUIS JSON from the frames.json file\n",
    "This dataset is in JSON format and contains a total of 1500 conversations. Each conversation consists of a series of messages exchanged between the user and the travel agent. The messages contain information about the user's travel preferences, such as departure city, destination city, travel dates, and budget.\n",
    "The dataset is divided into two parts: a training set and a test set. The training set contains 1200 conversations and is used to train the LUIS model. The test set contains 300 conversations and is used to evaluate the performance of the LUIS model.\n",
    "The dataset is available in the `data/frames_dataset` directory of the project. The main file is `frames.json`, which contains all the conversations. The file is structured as follows:\n",

    "The dataset contains conversation in French and English. The LUIS model must be able to understand both languages.\n",
    "Each conversation is identified by a unique ID and consists of multiple turns. Each turn has a speaker (either \"user\" or \"agent\") and the text of the message.\n",
    "The structure:\n",
    "* multiple turns per conversation (user and agent)\n",
    "* each turn has a speaker and text (frames)\n",
    "* information about travel preferences (departure city, destination city, travel dates, budget)\n",
    "The goal is to extract the relevant information (<user utterances>) from the conversations and format it according to the LUIS JSON structure.
