    "# Fly Me\n",
    "A travel provider for individuals and professionals. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The chatbot project - Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "Fly Me a travel agency has launched an ambitious project to develop a *chatbot* to *help users choose a travel offer*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first phase of this project is to **develop an MVP** that will help Fly Me employees to easily book airline tickets for their holidays.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first MVP will allow us to test the concept and performance of the chatbot quickly and on a large scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "As this project is iterative, we have limited the features of the chatbot V1. It must be able to identify the following five elements in the user's request:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Departure city\n",
    "* Destination city\n",
    "* Desired flight departure date\n",
    "* Desired flight return date\n",
    "* Maximum budget for the total price of tickets\n",
    "\n",
    "If one of the elements is missing, the chatbot must be able to ask the user the relevant questions in order to fully understand the request. When the chatbot thinks it has understood all the elements of the user's request, it must be able to reformulate the user's request and ask the user for confirmation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools and Technologies used\n",
    "To carry out this project, we will need to use the following tools and technologies:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Microsoft Bot Framework source code for Python “Microsoft Bot Framework SDK v4 for Python” \n",
    "* The Azure LUIS Cognitive Service which allows you to perform a semantic analysis of a message entered by the user and structure it for processing by the bot (it should allow you to identify the five elements requested)\n",
    "* The Azure Web App service that allows you to run a web application on the Azure Cloud (you won't need to use the Azure Bot service)\n",
    "* The Bot Framework Emulator which will allow you to test your chatbot locally and in production. It is an interface that allows a user to interact with the chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "The data used to train the LUIS model comes from a dataset of conversations between users and travel agents. This dataset is in JSON format and contains a total of 1500 conversations. Each conversation consists of a series of messages exchanged between the user and the travel agent. The messages contain information about the user's travel preferences, such as departure city, destination city, travel dates, and budget. For more details about the dataset, please refer to the original source: [Frames Dataset](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/frames-dataset/).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this project, the dataset is divided into two parts: a training set and a test set. The training set contains 80% conversations and is used to train the LUIS model, the remainder of the conversations are assigned to the test set. The test set is used to evaluate the performance of the LUIS model.\n",
    "The dataset is available in the `data/frames_dataset` directory of the project. The main file is `frames.json`, which contains all the conversations. The file is structured as follows:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"conversations\": [\n",
    "    {\n",
    "      \"id\": \"1\",\n",
    "      \"turns\": [\n",
    "        {\n",
    "          \"speaker\": \"user\",\n",
    "          \"text\": \"I want to book a flight from New York to Paris.\"\n",
    "        },\n",
    "        {\n",
    "          \"speaker\": \"agent\",\n",
    "          \"text\": \"Sure, when do you want to depart?\"\n",
    "        },\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "      ]\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "  ]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `turns` field contains a list of messages exchanged between the user and the travel agent. Each message has a `speaker` field indicating who sent the message (either \"user\" or \"agent\") and a `text` field containing the content of the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "The objective of this notebook is to explore and preprocess the dataset to prepare it for training the LUIS model. This includes loading the JSON file, flattening the nested structure, and extracting relevant information from the conversations. We will use the `pandas` library to manipulate the data and perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of the different entities and intents in the dataset."

    "## What is a bot?\n",
    "Bots provide an experience that feels less like using a computer and more like dealing with a person—or intelligent robot. Bots can used to shift simple, repetitive tasks—such as taking a dinner reservation or gathering profile information—onto automated systems that may no longer require direct human intervention. Users converse with a bot using text, interactive cards, and speech. A bot interaction can be a quick answer to a question or an involved conversation that intelligently provides access to services.\n",
    "\n",
    "In creating a bot, we define how the bot interacts with users, what services it connects to, and how it processes information. We can create bots that run in a variety of environments, including websites, apps, Microsoft Teams, Skype, Slack, Facebook Messenger, and more.\n",
    "For a detailed overview of bots, see [What are bots?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-overview-introduction?view=azure-bot-service-4.0). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we will create a bot that can help users book flights using the Language Understanding Interface System (LUIS) or the Conversational Language Understanding (CLU) model from Microsoft. To create the model we will define intents, entities, and utterances.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Intents**: \n",
    "\n",
    "An intent represents a task or action that the user wants to perform. It is the purpose of the user's input. For example, in our flight booking bot, we might have intents such as \"BookFlight\", \"CancelFlight\", and \"GetFlightStatus\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Entities**: \n",
    "\n",
    "Entities are used to extract specific pieces of information from the user's input that are relevant to the intent. For example, in the \"BookFlight\" intent, we might have entities such as \"DepartureCity\", \"DestinationCity\", \"DepartureDate\", \"ReturnDate\", and \"Budget\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Utterances**: \n",
    "\n",
    "Utterances are the actual phrases or sentences that users might say to express their intent. For example, for the \"BookFlight\" intent, some example utterances might be \"I want to book a flight from New York to Paris on June 1st and return on June 10th with a budget of $1000\" or \"Can you help me find a flight to London next month?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "* An **intent** represents the purpose of a user's input or a task/action a user wants to perform. It is the meaning of an utterance. In this case, the intent is to book a flight.\n",
    "* An **entity** are used to add specific context to intents. Represents a specific piece of information that is relevant to the intent. In this case, the entities are the departure city, destination city, departure date, return date, and budget.\n",
    "* An **utterance** is a phrase(s) that a user might enter when interacting with the application. It is a specific example of a user's input that expresses the intent. In this case, an utterance could be \"I want to book a flight from New York to Paris on June 1st and return on June 10th with a budget of $1000.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We create a model by defining intents and associating them with one or more utterances. We define the intents we want the model to understand. Every model must have a **None** intent (used to explicitly identify utterances that a user might submit, but for which there is no specific action required (for example, conversational greetings like \"hello\") or that fall outside of the scope of the domain for this model). We must define the entities that are relevant to the intent and annotate the utterances with the appropriate entities. This helps the model learn to recognize the intent and extract the relevant entities from user input. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model can then recognize the intent to book a flight and extract the relevant entities from the user's input. This model can then be integrated into a chatbot application to help users book flights.\n",
